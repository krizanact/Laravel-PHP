## Theme

This is Laravel/PHP project. It's about functional programming, user have to log in first or do
registration and then he can upload his documents and after it he can edit,download or delete any
document that he has actually uploaded. After user ends his session and log out, everything will be
stored so user will be able to see whatever he did next time when he logs in. Every user can see only
his documents so login is required.
Project has been worked in Laravel framework and I used: PHP, Bootstrap andHTML/CSS and
a little bit of Javascript.
